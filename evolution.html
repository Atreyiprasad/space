        <p>Our universe is 13.7 billion year old.:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Big Bang Theory: The universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, a hot and dense point that rapidly expanded, creating space, time, and matter.</li>
            <li>Formation of Elements: In the early universe, only the simplest elements like hydrogen and helium existed. Over time, stars formed and fused these elements into heavier elements through nuclear reactions.</li>
            <li>Stellar Nucleosynthesis: Stars go through their life cycles, and during their death stages (supernovae), they release elements like carbon, oxygen, and iron into space, enriching the universe with heavier elements.</li>
            <li>Formation of Planets: Gravity caused clouds of gas and dust to collapse, forming protoplanetary disks. In these disks, particles stuck together, eventually forming planets like Earth.</li>
            <li>Formation of Earth: About 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed in our solar system. It was initially a hot and barren planet.

Formation of Oceans: As Earth cooled, water vapor in the atmosphere condensed and fell as rain, creating Earth's oceans.</li>
            <li>Emergence of Life: Life likely emerged on Earth around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, possibly near hydrothermal vents in the ocean, where simple organic molecules could have combined to form the first life forms.</li>
            <li>Evolution by Natural Selection: Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection explains how life diversified and adapted to different environments over time through the mechanism of natural selection</li>
            <li>Complex Life Forms: Over billions of years, life on Earth evolved from simple single-celled organisms to complex multicellular life forms, including plants, animals, and humans.</li>
            <li>Diversity of Life: Life on Earth is incredibly diverse, with millions of species adapted to various ecosystems, showcasing the remarkable evolutionary journey that began with the formation of the universe</li>
      </ul>
